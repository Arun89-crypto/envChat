            A web based chatbot to track the carbon footprint of a user or a household. We expect the user to provide
            consumption information of various carbon emmisive products and services to calculate the total carbon
            footprint of the user. <br> This is done by comparing the data provided by the user and average carbon
            footprint
            of the device. We also intend to calculate the carbon absorption in the form of trees/plants grown by the
            user and also the situations in which the most efficient approach was utilized by the user to calculate the
            net carbon footprint in a day/week/month or year. <br> We hope this will spread awareness about the rising
            levels
            of greenhouse gases and encourage people to adopt cleaner and greener lifestyle.

        <p id="p1">
        <p id="p1">
            A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization,
            service, or
            product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases
            carbon
            dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance and the production
            and
            consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other
            services.
